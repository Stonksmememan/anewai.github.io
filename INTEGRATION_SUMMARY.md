## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: The generated site has placeholder text like "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"**
A: Normal! Those are intentional placeholders. Replace them with your actual credentials.

**Q: Do I need all the integrations listed for my industry?**
A: No! Pick and choose. The site works fine with just the UI - add integrations as needed.

**Q: Can I mix features from different industries?**
A: Yes! Use "Additional Changes" field to request specific features from other industries.

**Q: I don't have a business account for X service yet**
A: Most services offer instant sign-up. Start with free tiers and upgrade as needed.

**Q: The integration isn't working**
A: Double-check:
1. API keys are correct (no extra spaces)
2. Keys are for LIVE mode (not test mode)
3. Service is active in your third-party dashboard
4. Billing is set up if required
